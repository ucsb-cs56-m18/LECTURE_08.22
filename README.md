# REMINDER: EXAM RESCHEDULED

The midterm exam is moved one week into the future:

* WAS: This Thursday 08/23
* IS NOW: A week from Thursday, 08/30

Reason: Getting the "grading pipeline" flowing is taking a while because of the nature of summer courses.   I want you to have your graded work back a reasonable amount of time before the exam.

# HELP!  My submission compiles fine on CSIL/My own machine but not on Gradescope!  Wat?

The cause *might* be that there is something in the instructor tests that requires you to have
a certain method.

Real life example (though I may have this backwards, the main idea is correct):

* One student put `divideBy` in their code (and in their own tests!)
* But the instructions said to put `dividedBy` in the code, and that's what was in the instructor tests
* So, the student's compiled fine on CSIL: `divideBy` matched `divideBy`
* But when compiled on Gradescope, the instructor test for `dividedBy` didn't compile, so
   we couldn't run the tests.

Today:

* Sorting, Comparators, Lambdas (to: 10:15)

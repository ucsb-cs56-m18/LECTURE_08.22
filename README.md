# REMINDER: EXAM RESCHEDULED

The midterm exam is moved one week into the future:

* WAS: This Thursday 08/23
* IS NOW: A week from Thursday, 08/30

Reason: Getting the "grading pipeline" flowing is taking a while because of the nature of summer courses.   I want you to have your graded work back a reasonable amount of time before the exam.

Today:

* Sorting, Comparators, Lambdas (to: 10:15)
